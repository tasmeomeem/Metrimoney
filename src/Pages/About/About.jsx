                In Bangladesh, matrimony is often characterized by arranged marriages,
                where families play a pivotal role in match-making. Traditional values,
                cultural compatibility, and religious beliefs are key considerations in
                the matchmaking process. With the rise of technology, online matrimonial
                websites have gained popularity, providing individuals with a platform
                to search for potential life partners based on various criteria. Wedding
                ceremonies in Bangladesh are elaborate affairs, encompassing
                engagements, mehendi (henna), holud (turmeric ceremony), the wedding
                itself, and the walima (reception). Despite legal prohibitions,
                instances of dowry, though illegal, persist in some communities. The
                legal age for marriage is 18 for females and 21 for males, although
                efforts are ongoing to eradicate child marriages. Matrimony in
                Bangladesh reflects a blend of cultural richness, familial involvement,
                and adherence to traditional values.
